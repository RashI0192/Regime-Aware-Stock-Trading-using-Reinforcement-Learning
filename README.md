### Certainty Equivalent Reinforcement Learning (CERL) – *In Progress*
- This notebook explores and implements key ideas from the J.P. Morgan AI Research paper:
> **“Idiosyncrasies and Challenges of Data-Driven Learning in Electronic Trading”**  
> *V. Bacoyannis, V. Glukhov, T. Jin, J. Kochems, D. Song (2018)*  
> [arXiv:1811.09549](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09549)

- This notebook is an ongoing research implementation focused on

1. Modeling Certainty Equivalent Reinforcement Learning (CERL)

2. Building a risk-aware reward structure (inspired the the financial exponential utility functions proposed in the paper

3. also draws inspiration from other J.P. Morgan AI research and follow-up papers in the same series.
